    "\n[Step 1] Task: Search for 'Samsung smartphones'\n  -> Thought: I need to search for 'Samsung smartphones' on Amazon. I can see the search input field with ID 60 which has placeholder text 'Search Amazon.in'. I should click on this field and then type 'Samsung smartphones' to perform the search.",

    "\n[Step 2] Task: Apply price filter under 50000\n  -> Thought: I can see I'm on the Amazon homepage and I can see in the search bar that 'Samsung smartphones' has already been entered (as indicated in the recent action history). However, I need to search for Samsung smartphones first before I can apply price filters. I can see the search bar contains 'Samsung smartphones' but I need to execute the search by pressing enter or clicking the search button to get to the search results page where I can then apply filters.",

Looking at the action history, I can see that the previous actions were: 1) Fill search term 'Samsung smartphones' in element ID 60, and 2) Press enter on element ID 60. However, I'm still on the homepage and not seeing the search results page with filters. I should press enter on the search input field to execute the search and get to the results page where I can find rating filters.",

The previous actions show that someone searched for 'Samsung smartphones' and applied filters, but it seems we're not on a search results page right now. Looking at the page elements, I can see the search box (element 60) has 'Search Amazon.in' as placeholder text. I need to first search for Samsung smartphones to get to the results page before I can sort them.",

    "\n[Step 5] Task: Extract the top 5 product names, prices, and ratings\n  -> Thought: I can see that this appears to be the Amazon homepage and not the search results page for Samsung smartphones. Looking at the simplified page elements, I can see several product listings with prices and descriptions (elements 171-190), but these appear to be general deals from the homepage, not specifically Samsung smartphone search results. I need to first search for Samsung smartphones to get to the proper search results page before I can extract the top 5 Samsung smartphone names, prices, and ratings. I can see there's a search box (element 60) that shows 'Search Amazon.in', so I should search for Samsung smartphones first.",
