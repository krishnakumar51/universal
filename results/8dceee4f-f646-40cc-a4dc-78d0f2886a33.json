    "[Plan Generated]\nObjective: Find the top 5 latest samsung smartphones under 50000 with user ratings above 4 stars\nIntent: search_and_collect\nPlan:\n  - Navigate to the homepage\n  - Search for 'samsung smartphones'\n  - Apply price filter (up to 50000)\n  - Apply rating filter (4 stars and above)\n  - Sort results by latest\n  - Extract details of the top 5 products matching criteria\n  - Verify and compile the final list",
    "\n[Step 1] Thought: Based on the high-level plan, the first step is to navigate to the homepage. Since we are already on the Flipkart homepage (as evident from the image and the current URL), we can move on to the next step, which is to search for 'samsung smartphones'. I can see a search bar at the top of the page with the placeholder text 'Search for Products, Brands and More'. This is where we need to enter our search query.",
    "  -> Action: {\"type\": \"fill\", \"id\": \"4\", \"text\": \"samsung smartphones\"}\n  -> Outcome: Success",
    "\n[Step 2] Thought: The current viewport shows a blank white screen with only a small blue loading icon in the center. This indicates that the page is still loading after the search query was entered. The next step in our plan would be to search for 'samsung smartphones', but we've already filled the search bar in the previous action. Now, we need to wait for the page to load completely before we can proceed with the next steps of our plan. Since there are no visible interactive elements and the page is still loading, the best action is to wait and then scroll to see if the search results have appeared.",
    "  -> Action: {\"type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}\n  -> Outcome: Success",
    "\n[Step 3] Thought: The current viewport shows a loading indicator (a blue circular progress animation) in the center of the screen. This suggests that the page is still loading after our previous action of scrolling down. The next step in our plan would be to search for 'samsung smartphones', but we've already filled the search bar in a previous step. We now need to initiate the search, but we can't see any search button or input field in the current viewport. Given that the page is still loading and we can't see any interactive elements, the most appropriate action is to scroll down further to reveal more of the page content.",
    "  -> Action: {\"type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}\n  -> Outcome: Success",
    "\n[Step 4] Thought: The screenshot shows a mostly blank white page with a small blue loading circle in the center. This indicates that the page is still loading after our previous actions. We have already filled the search bar with 'samsung smartphones' and scrolled down twice. The next step in our plan would be to search for the products, but we can't do that until the page finishes loading and shows us the search results or a search button. Since there are no interactive elements visible and the page is still loading, the best action is to wait and then scroll down to see if we can find the search results or relevant filters.",

    "\n[Step 5] Thought: The current viewport shows a loading indicator (a blue circular progress icon) in the center of a white screen. This suggests that the search results are still loading after the previous actions. The next step in our plan is to apply price and rating filters, but we can't do that until the search results have loaded. Since there are no interactive elements visible and the page is still loading, the best action is to wait and then scroll down to see if the results have appeared.",

    "\n[Step 6] Thought: The current viewport shows a loading indicator (blue circular icon) in the center of the screen. This suggests that the page is still loading after our previous actions, which included filling the search bar with 'samsung smartphones' and scrolling down multiple times. The next step in our plan would be to search for the results, but we can't proceed until the page finishes loading. We need to wait for the loading to complete and for the search results to appear. Since there are no interactive elements visible and the page is still loading, the best action is to scroll down again to potentially reveal more content or to trigger the completion of the loading process.",

    "\n[Step 7] Thought: The current viewport shows a blank white page with only a small blue loading circle in the center. This indicates that the page is still loading or there might be an issue with the website. Since we've already scrolled down multiple times and still don't see any content, it's possible that the page is stuck or not loading properly. The next step in our plan is to navigate to the homepage and search for 'samsung smartphones', but we can't do that if the page isn't loading. At this point, we need to consider that there might be a technical issue preventing us from proceeding with the plan."
